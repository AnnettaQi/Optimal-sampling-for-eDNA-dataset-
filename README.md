# Optimal-sampling-tools-for-environmental DNA detection
Machine learning involved methods to determine survey sampling parameters for environmental DNA

Description:
A computer implemented method for determining survey
sampling parameters for environmental DNA ( eDNA )
detection comprises receiving a species selection identifying
selected species and receiving environmental specifications
for an environment to be tested for presence of the species .
A sampling plan is generated using the environmental speci
fications and the species selection , and detectability predic
tion ( s ) are generated using the environmental specifications ,
the species selection and the current sampling plan to predict
whether the selected species is detectable in the environment
according to the current sampling plan . Where at least one
respective selected species is undetectable according to the
current sampling plan , the process iterates , with each sub
sequent iteration incorporating an increase in the total vol
ume to be sampled , until either every respective selected
species is detectable according to the then - current sampling
plan or an iteration stop limit is reached . The sampling
plan ( s ) and detection prediction ( s ) are generated using dif
ferent algorithms
